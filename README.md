# Background Remover
Background Remover is a simple background removal application that utilizes the "rembg" library. This tool allows you to quickly and easily eliminate unwanted backgrounds from images.

# Key Features
Graphical User Interface (GUI): The application features an intuitive user interface that enables you to select images and process them with a single click.
Background Processing: The background removal process takes place in the background, allowing the user to continue working with the application without interruptions.
Original Image Backups: After processing the images, the application automatically moves the original images to a backup folder, ensuring that no important data is lost.

# Usage
Open the application and click "Add Images" to select the images you want to process.
You can remove selected images from the list by clicking "Remove Selected."
Once you've selected the images, click "Process Images" to start the background removal process.
The progress bar will show you the processing progress, and upon completion, you'll see a "Image processing completed!" message.
